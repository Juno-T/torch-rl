# RL algorithms with JAX

Hands-on project after finishing [Deepmind's RL course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDVH599EItlEWsUOsJbAodm). First I learned and used JAX for the implementations, but I found that it took too much time to debug anything because of the lack of documentation (mostly for haiku) and forums. I decided to abandon [the project](https://github.com/Juno-T/jax-rl) and re-implement & re-design it in PyTorch instead.

:construction: The project is still in progress.
